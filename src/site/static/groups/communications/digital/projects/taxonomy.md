- Project status: Alpha
- Dependencies: [Content Hub](content-hub.html) integration, as well as prototype [group pages](group-pages.html), [landing pages](landing-pages.html), and [embl.org](embl-org.html).

### Summary

A list of terms that describe the content across [embl.org](embl-org.html). This will be an inter-related system of taxonomies for aggregation and syndication of content.

Terms were sourced from a content audit of the top 1000 links on [embl.de](http://www.embl.de), as well as terms list from [*EMBLetc*](http://news.embl.de).

### Prototypes

- Drupal site: [EMBL taxonomies](http://dev-embl-taxonomies.pantheonsite.io/) (Alpha)

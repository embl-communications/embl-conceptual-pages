- Project status: Not started
- Dependencies: Various (systems need to be built and working at least in Alpha before we can write meaningful documentation)

### Summary

Enough written documentation for others to understand how to use the tools the digital team is creating and working with. Need this to be centralised and clearly navigable.

### Examples

- [*Bynder* docs](https://stratcom.gitlab.io/bynder/post/)
- [*Digital Weekly Production* Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Pph11bBp/digital-weekly-production)
- [Notes on taxonomy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bdMgljt5z6kbvhtz6wRHdiSxbJ_frA9JYeeOUUf7KFc/edit?ts=5b729ab2)

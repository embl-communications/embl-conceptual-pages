### Summary

Springboard is a set of popular links, localised for EMBL sites, that respond to user need. Links are chosen based on a "Top Tasks" analysis: results of surveys which determine which sites users need the most on a daily basis.

Later iterations may include site-specific information and updates, such as shuttle timetables and daily restaurant menus.

### Prototypes

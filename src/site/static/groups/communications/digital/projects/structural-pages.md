### Summary

- Project status: Alpha
- Dependencies: Wordpress theme, Page builder system

Structural pages are parts of the website that represent the structure of the organisation. Departmental pages such as Finance and Human Resources, the Jobs page, Press and Course and Conferences are all structural pages. Individual research unit pages are structural pages.

We use the term structural page to distinguish from [landing pages](landing-pages.html), which aggregate content based on a given topic.

So to recap: Pages such as "DNA" or "genetics" are landing pages. Pages such as "Genetics research unit" are structual.

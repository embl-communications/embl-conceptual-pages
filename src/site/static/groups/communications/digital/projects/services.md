### Summary

A scalable, digital list linking to the hundreds of services that EMBL offers. Includes service descriptions and contact information.

Services are defined in different ways by different teams. The Pepcore servic in Heidelberg, for example, provides protein purification after in-depth consultation and phone conversations directly with a variety of clients. By contrast, the Ensembl database is a quick look-up of specific nucleotide sequences. Listing these diverse services in an intelligible and searchable fashion is a considerable challenge of [information architecture](information-architecture.html).

The services list should serve as an index, redirecting to pages with more information about individual services, as well as contact information for each service provider.

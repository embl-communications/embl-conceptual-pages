### Summary

Migrating events and courses data to new systems which integrate with the Content Hub.

The Courses and Conferences (CCO) department have a user registration system for events. These keep a database of users and the conferences that they attended. Members of the department also post the same events to the EMBL website using Fiona.

Plan: Integrate the events systems with the Content Hub, so that CCO do not have to post everything twice.

### Prototypes

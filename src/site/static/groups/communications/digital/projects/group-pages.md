### Summary

This project will deliver Wordpress installations with the EMBL theme for 10 group pages. The minimum viable product (MVP) for a group page is a Wordpress site with the tabs About, Members, Publications and Contact. We will start with the groups that use this existing structure with no bespoke tabs.

### Prototypes

- Design from Mark
- [Group pages content audit](https://bit.ly/2H1xEnI)
- [Visual Framework](http://dev-vf-theme-prototype.pantheonsite.io/)

### Summary

News at EMBL is published in several places:
- [*EMBLetc*](https://news.embl.de/)
- [EBI news](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/news)

These are separate systems that do not integrate. The aim is to pull all news into the Content Hub, and provide tools to make it easily shareable, and publishable anywhere. Users will be able to query the Content Hub for "Latest five news articles from EBI on the topic of protein structure", for example, and then add that container of content to their site.
